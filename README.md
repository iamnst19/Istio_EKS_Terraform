## Description of the project:
In this project we will be setting up an EKS cluster from sratch, install Istio with the help of istio operators (CRD). Then install a sample app to test the capabilities of istio and use the same for Traffic Management to the deployed application. 

## About Istio:
Istio is an open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. Istio’s powerful features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services. Istio is the path to load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring – with few or no service code changes.
